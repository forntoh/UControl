**A NetBeans projet**

<p>Have you often found yourself trying to control two computers at once, and getting confused like which keyboard and which mouse goes with which? <b>WTF!</b></p>
<p>UniC is here to solve the problem, you no longer need two keyboards or mice, with UniC, you can share your mouse and keyboard with all your PCs without getting confused, it even saves you money from buying mice and keyboards.</p>
<p>Right now most of the features are not yet available, but they will be available soon.<p>

This version is based on **`Java Swing`**
